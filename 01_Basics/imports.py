Python Import 
==============

Apart from the functions that we saw up until now, there are
thousands of functions which are not by default available in Python.

We can import those functionalities using module imports or otherwise known
as libraries.

Let's see how we can import some of the common modules

`random` module contains many functions for getting randomised outputs,
like a random number between a range.

`string` module contains many string related functionalities,
like getting a string of a-z, A-Z, a string containing punctuations and so on

# import random
# from string import ascii_lowercase

# while True:
#     inp = input("See an English alphaber?"
#                 ", Y/N to reply: ")
#     if inp.lower() == 'y':
#         print(ascii_lowercase[random.randint(0,25)])
#     elif inp.lower() == 'n':
#         break
#     else:
#         continue
