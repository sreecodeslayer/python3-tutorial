======================
User inputs in Python
======================

We will use this file to write a simple program that let's user feed data to program
'''

# print("Hello user,")
# name = input("What can I call you?\n")
# age = input("How old are you?\n")
# print("Hi %s, you are going to be %s next year" % (name, int(age)+1)
# print("You just earned stars!")
# print('*'*int(age))

'''
Well you can go creative with this function, and do many things
from calculating how long the name is to building a biodata for the user.
It is all upto you, but to do those we need to learn more.

So once  you have learnt the basics of python, you can come back to this file and 
add up features to the small program, go crazy.
